# AWS-S3
Explore AWS S3 AWS skill builder lab 


📌 Description

This project demonstrates a complete hands-on implementation of Amazon S3 with EC2 integration, focusing on secure data storage, controlled access, and protection against accidental deletion.
An EC2 instance uploads and retrieves daily report files to/from an Amazon S3 bucket using IAM roles, bucket policies, ACLs, and versioning.

This lab is completed as part of AWS Skill Builder – Getting Started with Amazon S3.

📘 Introduction

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a highly scalable, secure, and durable object storage service.
In real-world enterprise environments, applications running on EC2 instances often need to store logs, reports, or backups in S3 securely.

This project simulates a real production-like scenario where:

Only an EC2 instance can write data to an S3 bucket

Objects can be read securely

Accidental deletion is prevented using versioning

🔍 Overview

Created a globally unique S3 bucket

Uploaded and accessed objects securely

Configured Block Public Access, ACLs, and Bucket Policies

Enabled EC2 → S3 communication using IAM Role

Implemented S3 Versioning for data protection

Tested upload, download, delete, and restore operations

🛠️ Technology Used
Service / Tool	Purpose
Amazon S3	Object storage for reports
Amazon EC2	Application server
IAM Role	Secure access control
Bucket Policy	Fine-grained permission control
AWS CLI	Upload and download objects
AWS Systems Manager	Secure EC2 access
AWS Management Console	Configuration and monitoring
⚙️ Project Setup

AWS Account with Skill Builder Lab access

EC2 instance with IAM Role attached

AWS CLI pre-installed on EC2

Internet-enabled AWS Console

🧪 Task 1: Create an S3 Bucket

In this task, a new Amazon S3 bucket was created to store daily report files generated by an EC2-based application.

Key configuration steps:

Bucket name was made globally unique using the AWS account ID

Object Ownership was set to ACLs enabled with Object Writer

Default AWS region was used

Block Public Access was enabled by default for security

This step ensures a secure and isolated storage location for application-generated data

🧪 Task 2: Upload an Object to the Bucket

After creating the bucket, an object (new-report.png) was uploaded to test basic S3 functionality.

Key highlights:

Used S3 Upload Wizard

Verified upload success via console

Confirmed object listing inside the bucket

This validated that the bucket was functional and ready for use.

Output:

🧪 Task 3: Make an Object Public

Amazon S3 objects are private by default.

Steps performed:

Attempted to access the object using Object URL (Access Denied)

Disabled Block Public Access at bucket level

Applied public-read ACL to a specific object

Verified public access via browser

This task demonstrated how bucket-level security overrides object permissions.

Ouput:

🧪 Task 4: Test Connectivity from EC2 Instance

Connected to the EC2 instance using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.

Commands executed:

aws s3 ls
aws s3 ls s3://reportbucket-XXXX


Observations:

EC2 could list buckets and objects

Upload (PutObject) failed due to missing permissions

This confirmed read-only access before policy update.

Output

🧪 Task 5: Create a Bucket Policy

A bucket policy was created to allow:

EC2 IAM Role → PutObject & GetObject

Public users → GetObject

Policy creation involved:

IAM Role ARN retrieval

AWS Policy Generator usage

Attaching policy to the bucket

Post-policy verification:

EC2 successfully uploaded and downloaded files

Browser access worked for public objects

Output

🧪 Task 6: Explore Versioning

Versioning was enabled to protect data from accidental deletion.

Key experiments:

Uploaded multiple versions of the same file

Observed delete markers

Restored deleted objects

Permanently deleted specific versions

This task proved that versioning ensures data recovery and auditability.
